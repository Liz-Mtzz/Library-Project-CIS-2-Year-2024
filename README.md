This is a group project for the CIS 76 class in the Fall semester of 2024 at Evergreen Community College. 
We are working together to implement a Library managment system by filling in the TODO secions of code in the: 
  -Library.java
  -Book.java
The other files are for testing of the code by running Driver.java.

We are testing our code directily in the main of Library.java as well and implementing both data structures the unordered linked list and the binary search tree in Libary.java. We included the number of available books as part of the payload in the node of the binary search tree. The Driver files have been deleted form this Project code.
